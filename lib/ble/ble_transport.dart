/// Attachment state for BLE transports.
///
/// Represents whether a transport is attached to its BLE service on a connected device.
/// The physical device connection is managed by [BleDevice], while transports attach to
/// specific GATT services on the already-connected device.
enum TransportState { detached, attaching, attached }

/// Abstract interface for BLE protocol implementations.
///
/// A transport IS a protocol implementation (FTMS, Heart Rate, Cycling Power, etc.).
/// Multiple transports (protocols) can be active on the same physical device,
/// each handling communication with a specific Bluetooth service.
///
/// Each transport is responsible for:
/// - Detecting its own compatibility with devices
/// - Connecting to and communicating with its BLE service
/// - Parsing protocol-specific data
/// - Managing its own lifecycle
///
/// Transports implement capability interfaces (PowerProvider, CadenceProvider, etc.)
/// to expose their data streams. The implemented interfaces determine the transport's
/// possible capabilities.
///
/// Examples: FtmsBleTransport, HeartRateBleTransport, CyclingPowerBleTransport
///
/// See docs/BLE_DEVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md for detailed architecture documentation.

  // Compatibility Detection (Two-Phase)
  // ============================================================================

  /// **Phase 1: Fast compatibility check using only advertising data.**
  ///
  /// Called by BLE Scanner for every discovered device to determine if this
  /// device should be shown to the user as a compatible fitness device.
  ///
  /// **NO BLE CONNECTION REQUIRED** - only uses advertising data:
  /// - Service UUIDs in advertisement
  /// - Manufacturer ID and manufacturer data
  /// - Device name patterns
  /// - RSSI (if protocol requires minimum signal strength)
  ///
  /// Must be FAST (< 1ms) as it runs for every discovered device during scanning.
  ///
  /// Returns true if this transport can potentially work with the device.
  ///
  /// Example (simple case):
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// bool canSupport(DiscoveredDevice device) {
  ///   return device.serviceUuids.contains(heartRateServiceUuid);
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Example (complex case):
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// bool canSupport(DiscoveredDevice device) {
  ///   // Check manufacturer ID and service UUID
  ///   return device.manufacturerId == wahooId &&
  ///          device.serviceUuids.contains(wahooServiceUuid);
  /// }
  /// ```
  bool canSupport(DiscoveredDevice device);

  /// **Phase 2: Deep compatibility check after connecting (optional).**
  ///
  /// Called AFTER device connection and service discovery, but BEFORE attach().
  /// Can perform checks that require reading characteristics:
  /// - Read firmware version to check protocol compatibility
  /// - Check protocol version
  /// - Verify required characteristics exist
  /// - Test read/write permissions
  /// - Validate device capabilities
  ///
  /// **REQUIRES BLE CONNECTION** - involves actual BLE communication.
  /// May take longer (100-500ms) as it reads from the device.
  ///
  /// The [device] is already connected and [services] have been discovered.
  /// Use these to perform deep compatibility checks before committing to attach().
  ///
  /// Returns true if device fully supports this transport, false otherwise.
  ///
  /// **Default implementation returns true** (no deep check needed).
  /// Most simple protocols only need `canSupport()` and can skip this.
  ///
  /// Example (when needed):
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// Future<bool> verifyCompatibility({
  ///   required BluetoothDevice device,
  ///   required List<BluetoothService> services,
  /// }) async {
  ///   // Find firmware version characteristic
  ///   final fwChar = services
  ///       .expand((s) => s.characteristics)
  ///       .firstWhere((c) => c.uuid == firmwareVersionUuid);
  ///
  ///   // Read firmware version
  ///   final version = await fwChar.read();
  ///
  ///   // Check if version supports our protocol implementation
  ///   return parseFirmwareVersion(version) >= minimumSupportedVersion;
  /// }
  /// ```
