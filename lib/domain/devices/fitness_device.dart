/// Abstract interface for all fitness devices.
///
/// This is the core abstraction that separates domain logic from protocol
/// implementations and Bluetooth transport. All fitness devices (trainers,
/// power meters, cadence sensors, heart rate monitors) implement this interface.
///
/// Implementations exist for different protocols:
/// - FTMS (Fitness Machine Service) - most modern trainers
/// - Wahoo proprietary protocol - KICKR and CORE trainers
/// - Bluetooth Cycling Power Service - standalone power meters
/// - Bluetooth CSC Service - cadence/speed sensors
/// - Bluetooth Heart Rate Service - heart rate monitors
///
/// This interface contains NO Bluetooth code - all BLE details are isolated
/// in the transport layer. This enables full testability with mock devices
/// that behave realistically without requiring actual hardware.
